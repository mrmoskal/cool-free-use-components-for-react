# About This Project

- This project is just me goofing around with `react js` & `css`

- However, I thought it'll be cool to shere some of the things here (how knows... maybe someone might think they're cool, and would like to use them)

- No need to give credit to me if you use them. (of course - if you'd like to, I won't mide :wink: )

### _Additional Libraries For This Repository:_

---

- This project inclodes `routing`, therefore the `react-routing-dom` library is included.
  <br />
  Due to that, make sure to add the following library (if you're new to `react`, or aren't used to using `npm` - just write the following `npm` command in the terminal of your projects' folder :thumbsup:):

```cmd
npm install react-router-dom
```
