# How Do I Use This Component?

This component isn't _REALY_ a component... it's just `css`.

All it does is make your container a little more stylish.

### **Example:**

---

- First, import the sytles for the stylish container:

```javascript
import stylish_container_styles from "<style module path>";
```

- Then, add the _`container`_ class to your chosen element (in this example - a `div`):

```jsx
<div className={stylish_container_styles.container}>{/* your children elements here */}<div>
```
